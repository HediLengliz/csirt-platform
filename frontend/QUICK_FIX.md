# ✅ Frontend Error Fixed!

## Issue
The error was: `FileAlert` icon doesn't exist in lucide-react.

## Solution
Replaced `FileAlert` with `FileText` (a valid lucide-react icon) in:
- `src/components/Layout.tsx`
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- `src/pages/Incidents.tsx`

## Changes Made
- ✅ Replaced `FileAlert` → `FileText` 
- ✅ Removed unused imports (`TrendingUp`, `Filter`)
- ✅ All files updated and working

## Next Steps
The frontend should now work correctly. Refresh your browser and the error should be gone!

If you see any other errors, let me know.
